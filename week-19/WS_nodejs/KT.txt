******************************* what are microservices *****************************************************

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business function.

üß± Key Characteristics:
Single Responsibility: Each microservice focuses on one function (e.g., user authentication, payment processing).

Independently Deployable: Services can be built, tested, deployed, and scaled independently.

Language & Tech Agnostic: Different services can use different programming languages or databases.

Own Data Storage: Each service manages its own database to avoid tight coupling.

Communicate via APIs: Typically use lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message queues.

üì¶ Microservices vs Monolith:
Feature	Monolithic             Architecture	                          Microservices Architecture
Codebase	               Single codebase	                          Multiple codebases (per service)
Deployment	               Deploy whole app at once	                  Deploy services independently
Scaling	Scale entire app       Scale individual services		  Scale individual services
Team Structure	               One team for all features	          Multiple teams for different services
Fault Tolerance	               One failure can bring down all	          Failures isolated to one service

üßë‚Äçüíª Example:
A food delivery app might have:

Auth Service ‚Äì Handles login and registration
Restaurant Service ‚Äì Manages restaurant data
Order Service ‚Äì Processes orders
Payment Service ‚Äì Handles payments
Notification Service ‚Äì Sends email/SMS updates

Each can be developed and deployed independently.

‚úÖ Benefits:
Faster development and deployment
Better scalability
Easier to adopt new technologies
Improved fault isolation

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
Complexity in communication
Distributed data management
Requires strong DevOps and monitoring
Harder debugging across services
